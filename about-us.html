							<h4>KIDZONE’S PHILOSOPHY</h4>
							<p>Children are
								active learners who learn best
								from activities that they plan,
								carry out, and reflect on.
								<br>
								-&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s been proven that learning a second language at the young age can
								benefits
								a child’s ability to learn and to think. Like Elaine Schneider expressed: “A child’s
								brain
								is like a sponge, it absorbs all the information and knowledge around them like the
								sponge
								“sucks up” all the water around it. The earlier a language is introduced to a child, the
								faster
								and easier she/he “absorbs” it. Remember, a child’s senses are super active because they
								are still
								pure, so they can imitate the accent more accurately. Language should be introduced
								before the age
								of 6 or 7. It’s always better to learn early.
								<br>
								-&nbsp;&nbsp; At Kidzone, we offer a bilingual environment where English and Vietnamese
								are spoken frequently.
								Therefore, children have opportunities to develop their English skills in the early
								years of their life.
								Communicating with native English teachers daily helps them to have an accurate accent,
								faster reaction
								and most importantly, the habit of speaking English.
								<br>
								-&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides developing your child’s cognitive readiness, we also focus on
								encouraging
								them to expand their interest in arts and completing their social and emotional
								development.
								Kidzone is where children receive the most support throughout their&nbsp; early
								development;
								and are encouraged to appreciate the beauty of art and life, along with life skills
								<br>
								-&nbsp;&nbsp; At Kidzone, children are taught to love and embrace nature. This love is
								not just
								about appreciating the beauty of nature but also to protect it every day by reducing,
								reusing,
								recycling (for example, making arts and crafts from trash) and growing a green
								environment.
								<br>
								-&nbsp;&nbsp; Our aim is to have healthy and happy children. That is why we provide a
								safe &amp;
								friendly learning environment. Safety is our primary concern. Classrooms are gradually
								cleaned.
								Instead of commercial cleaning products (which may contain chemicals &amp; toxic
								substances),
								we use plants from our own garden to create aromas and natural insect repellent.
								<br>
								-&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutritious and kid friendly menu including healthy dishes using fresh and
								natural
								ingredients freshly cooked every day from Kidzone’s kitchen will keep your child healthy
								and energized.

							<h4>KIDZONE’S MISSION</h4>
							<p>
								“If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of
								at least one adult
								who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement, and mystery of the world
								we live in.”
								said Rachel Carson
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe that children learn best through playing with their peers and through a
								close,
								loving relationship with adults. This is the reason why we have created a fun play
								ground
								where children are free to play and discover, to inspire them to love learning, in order
								to help your them develop completely and contentedly.
							</p>
							<p>
								At Kidzone we utilize materials, activities &amp; teaching methods that help children to
								interact with the world around them. We nourish your child’s sense of wonder by giving
								them
								opportunities to learn and experience things for themselves. Every child is unique, and
								for
								that reason we respect every moment of each child’s development.
								<br>
								We provide a community link between school and parents which keep both side updated with
								your child’s progression
							</p>
							<br>

							<h4>A STORY ABOUT US</h4>
							<p>Children are born ready to learn & discover.
								Children are born wanting to understand all of the world around them.
								Educational research has shown that children need a learning environment that allows
								children to learn for themselves. The role of adults in early childhood education is
								to encourage & support children, so that their natural aptitude for learning stays with
								them for the rest of their lives.
							</p>
							<p>
								The learning environment plays a hugely important role in stimulating a child’s natural
								learning ability. Young children need a space to play which is safe and welcoming,
								where they can interact with nature and experience for themselves the world around them;
								and they can embrace the love from their parents
							</p>
							<p>
								Research has proven that the earliest interactions in a child’s life have a direct
								effect
								on the development of their brain. Hence, having a warm and loving environment is not
								only
								important for a child to feel comfortable; it also has a direct effect on their
								development.
								Therefore, one of the most important factors for the development of a child is a close
								connection with the person who takes care of them.
							</p>
							<p>
								Kidzone was founded by experts in the field of education who above all else are parents
								who love caring for children, and who wish to n provide a learning environment where
								children will receive the best care from the very beginning of their lives, and where
								their
								natural ability for learning will be nurtured. If you come to Kidzone, you will see that
								it is a child’s paradise, a place where your child will have the opportunity to learn
								for
								themselves through play, a place where your child can be truly independent, and at the
								same
								time a place where your child will be completely safe.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the place where your child will take their first steps in the wider world, Kidzone is
								not
								any ordinary school. It is a beautiful, colorful world of its own which your children
								can learn
								and discover. Our weekend playdates are opportunities for you and your children to play
								and learn
								together. Through our love for children, and our deep understanding of how children
								learn and our
								dedication to our responsibilities, Kidzone is a place which can contribute to your
								child’s happiness
								and love of learning.
							</p>
